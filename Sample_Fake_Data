## 1. Profile Agent: Sample Patient & Donor Personas

### Sample Patient Profile Input (Free-form text user would type)

```
My name is Alex and I'm 34 years old. I've been waiting for a kidney transplant for about 2 years now. 
I live in Portland, Oregon and I'm on dialysis 3 times a week. My blood type is O positive. 
I really love hiking and playing guitar, but the dialysis schedule has made it hard to do those things. 
I work part-time as a software engineer from home. If someone could help me get a transplant, 
I could get my life back and maybe start a family someday. I'm healthy otherwise—no diabetes or heart disease. 
I'm happy to answer any questions about my medical history.

Hi, I'm Jamie, 41. I've been thinking about donating a kidney for a few years now 
and I think I'm ready to move forward. I'm in Boston and my blood type is O. 
I'm a nurse so I understand the medical side pretty well. 
I don't have any major health issues—just asthma which is controlled. 
I'm not looking for anything in return, I just want to help someone. 
I have a supportive family and I've already discussed this with them.

## Usage Notes

- All names, emails, and company information are **entirely fictional**
- Email patterns use `@example.com` and `@demo.com` domains to avoid real inbox delivery
- Blood types, organ types, and medical conditions are realistic but combined randomly
- Dates are recent but synthetic; no actual person identifiers
- Use this data confidently in local development, demos, and non-production environments
- When moving to production, replace with real data and implement proper privacy controls
