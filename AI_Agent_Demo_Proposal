# MatchingDonors AI Agent Demo Project Proposal

**Project**: AI-Powered Assistant Suite for Patient/Donor Matching, Content Discovery, and Advertiser Engagement  
**Duration**: 4–6 weeks (MVP prototype with fake data)  
**Volunteer**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates three complementary AI agents that directly support MatchingDonors' core business goals:
1. **Profile Agent** – Help patients and donors complete profiles faster and more effectively
2. **Content Agent** – Auto-label news articles for topic-based subscriptions across DailyDiabetesNews, DailyTransplantNews, and IrishDailyTransplantNews
3. **Advertiser Agent** – Provide intelligent lead capture and FAQ support for potential advertisers

Using fake data and synthetic personas, we'll validate feasibility, gather user feedback, and establish a foundation for production integration.

## Problem Statement & Opportunity

**Current challenges:**
- Patient/donor profile creation is manual and slow; many incomplete submissions reduce match quality
- News content across three websites lacks structured metadata; users cannot easily filter by topic or organ type
- Advertiser inquiries are ad-hoc; leads are not systematically captured or qualified

**Opportunity:**
- AI agents can guide profile creation conversationally, ensuring completeness and compliance
- Auto-labeling enables topic subscriptions, improving engagement and ad inventory value
- Chatbot-driven lead capture reduces friction and ensures no advertiser inquiry is lost

## Scope & Deliverables (Phase 1)

| Component | What's Included | What's Not (Phase 2+) |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Profile Agent** | Demo UI, LLM-based profile editor, safety filters, simple embedding-based matching | Integration with live MatchingDonors database |
| **Content Agent** | Web crawler (4 sites), auto-labeler (LLM), topic subscription UI, sample email digest | Real user authentication, analytics dashboard |
| **Advertiser Agent** | Chatbot UI, FAQ knowledge base, lead capture form, email summary export | CRM integration, approval workflow automation |

---

## Technical Architecture

**Tech Stack (all open-source / free-tier available):**
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (or Vue)
- **Backend API**: FastAPI (Python) or Node.js/Express
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API (paid), Hugging Face (free), or open-source models (Llama 2)
- **Vector Database**: Chroma or Pinecone (free tier)
- **Web Crawler**: BeautifulSoup + Requests or Scrapy
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (local or cloud)
- **Hosting**: Docker + local dev or free tier (Heroku, Railway, Render for demo)

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Modular**: Each agent is an independent microservice
- **Privacy-first**: Fake data only; no real PHI stored during prototype
- **Extensible**: Easy to swap LLM providers or add new agents
- **Demo-friendly**: Clear before/after examples, no complex authentication

## Success Metrics

| Agent | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Profile** | Profile completion rate, time-to-complete, manager feedback on tone/compliance | >80% completion, <5 min avg, 0 flagged safety issues in sample set |
| **Content** | Label accuracy (manual spot-check), user interest in topics | >85% accuracy on 20-article spot check |
| **Advertiser** | Lead capture rate, completeness of extracted info | 100% of test inquiries → valid lead records |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| LLM hallucinations (e.g., unsafe profile suggestions) | Implement prompt engineering, safety rules, human review step |
| Crawler blocked or changes site structure | Use robots.txt responsibly, add error handling, maintain crawler robustness |
| Privacy concerns with fake data | Clearly label all data as synthetic; use non-realistic names and email patterns |
| Scope creep (trying to build too much) | Strict Agile sprints; if feature doesn't fit 2-week sprint, defer to Phase 2 |

---

## Timeline & Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1–2 | Setup, fake data generation, architecture design | GitHub repo, sample data files, API spec |
| 3–4 | Profile Agent MVP + demo UI | Working profile editor with matching suggestions |
| 5–6 | Content Agent MVP + Advertiser Agent MVP | Crawler, auto-labels, advertiser lead form |
| End | Demo presentation + feedback session | Video walkthrough, feedback notes for Phase 2 |

## Next Steps

1. **Manager review & approval** – Confirm scope, tech stack, and success metrics align with organizational goals
2. **Set up dev environment** – Git repo, coding standards, deployment target
3. **Weekly sync** – Short 15-min check-ins to unblock and gather feedback
4. **Public data only** – Confirm that fake/synthetic data is sufficient for Phase 1

**Questions for Manager:**
- Any preference on LLM provider (OpenAI, open-source, Hugging Face)?
- Should this eventually integrate with existing MatchingDonors tech stack, or stay standalone for now?
- Who should review advertiser leads—you directly, or via a simple internal queue?
