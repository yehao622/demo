To keep continuity, do this when you start a new conversation:

Paste a short project context block
Include:

Project name and goal

Tech stack choices

Current status (what’s implemented / what’s next)

Example you can reuse:

I’m building a volunteer project for MatchingDonors: an AI-assisted profile agent, content labeling agent, and advertiser chatbot.
Tech stack: Node.js + Express (TS/JS), React, PostgreSQL, Gemini API, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Jest, ELK.
We already planned functions for each module (profile parsing, Gemini prompts, embeddings, crawler, advertiser lead extraction). Please continue from that design and help me implement the next functions.

Reference key artifacts
Mention the documents created:

“AI_Agent_Demo_Proposal”

“Sample_Fake_Data”

“Tech_Stack_Licensing_Guide”
And, if needed, re-attach or paste the parts you want to work on.

Be explicit about where to resume
For example:

“Continue from the Profile Agent module: implement parseFreeTextProfile and buildProfilePrompt in TypeScript.”

“Now help me write K8s manifests based on the earlier architecture.”

Optionally keep your own notes

Maintain a NOTES.md in your repo with:

The function list

Design decisions

Links/snippets you want to paste back into future chats

In the next conversation, if you paste the function roadmap (or just say “continue from the 23-function roadmap we discussed, starting at function X”), it will be straightforward to pick up exactly where you left off and start writing concrete TS/JS code.
