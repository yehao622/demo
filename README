## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yehao622/demo.git
cd demo

2. Backend Setup
# Navigate to backend directory
cd matchingdonors-backend

# Install dependencies

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Backend won't start:

Verify Node.js version: node --version (should be >= 18)
Check if port 8080 is available
Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in .env

Frontend can't connect to backend:
Verify backend is running on port 8080
Check CORS settings in backend
Ensure REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL is correct

AI responses are slow:
This is expected with Gemini API (can take 2-5 seconds)
Consider implementing response streaming for better UX

Voice input not working:
Requires HTTPS or localhost
Check browser microphone permissions
Only supported in Chrome, Edge, Safari

🎨 Features Showcase
AI-Powered Profile Creation
The questionnaire adapts based on user responses, asking relevant follow-up questions to build comprehensive donor/patient profiles.

Intelligent Matching Algorithm
Evaluates medical compatibility, geographic proximity, and urgency to rank potential matches with detailed explanations.

Natural Language News Search
Users can ask questions naturally: "latest kidney donation news" or "heart transplant success rates 2025"

Business Chatbot with Lead Capture
Handles advertising inquiries, provides metrics, and captures qualified leads with CRM integration readiness.

🔐 Security Notes
API keys should never be committed to version control

Use .env files (already in .gitignore)

For production, implement proper authentication

Sanitize all user inputs before AI processing
