## Legal Considerations for MatchingDonors

### Data Compliance
- ✅ Using **fake/synthetic data** = no HIPAA, GDPR, or CCPA concerns during MVP
- ✅ All recommended tech is **open-source** = no licensing costs or restrictions
- ✅ No proprietary dependencies = easy to switch vendors or host yourself later

### Nonprofit Status
- If MatchingDonors is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, you may qualify for:
  - **Google Cloud credits** ($200–1000/year)
  - **Microsoft Azure credits** ($1000/year via TechSoup)
  - **AWS credits** for nonprofits (via AWS Community Tech)
- These would further reduce hosting costs to $0

### Open-Source Contribution
- All your code can be open-sourced later (using MIT or Apache 2.0 license)
- This follows nonprofit best practices and attracts community contributions

## Recommendations for Your Project

1. **Use this exact stack**—you have zero licensing concerns, zero cost barriers
2. **Start with OpenAI API** ($5 free trial) for LLM integration; upgrade to open-source models later if needed
3. **Host locally or on Railway** during development; push to production tier only when ready to launch
4. **Keep all code in a private GitHub repo** until you're ready to open-source
5. **Document your tech choices** in a `ARCHITECTURE.md` file so the manager knows everything is free and nonprofit-safe

---

## Questions to Confirm with Manager

1. **"Can I use OpenAI API on a free trial ($5 credit) for the demo LLM features?"** (Recommended: Yes, very low cost and full freedom to use)
2. **"Should the final code be open-sourced, or kept proprietary?"** (Impacts license choice later, but doesn't affect your prototyping freedom now)
3. **"Does MatchingDonors have nonprofit cloud credits I should register for?"** (Could save $100s/year on hosting)
